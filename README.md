# mkdocs template repo

## Overview

[mkdocs](https://www.mkdocs.org/) is a tool for building simple static documentation from Markdown files, with extensions allowing for:

- Auto-generating Python API documentation
- Deploying documents to GitHub Pages

See an example of what you can build on the GitHub Pages site for this repo: <https://cdcent.github.io/cfa-mkdocs-template>

## Getting started

### Essentials

To use this template, you'll need to copy over these files:

- `mkdocs.yaml`: Configure this file to account for your document structure, repo URL, etc.
- `docs/index.md`: You will always want an `index.md`. You can add other `.md`s under `docs/`.

The Python dependencies are in `requirements.txt`. For example, if you are using [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv), you could run:

    uv add --dev $(cat requirements.txt)

There is no need to keep this file in your repo.

The `.gitignore` in this repo has just one entry, `site/`, which is the default location where `mkdocs build` will put locally built docs.

You should now be able to `mkdocs serve` and `mkdocs build`!

### Optional things

#### YAML checking bugs

Some of the Markdown extensions in `mkdocs.yaml` are "unsafe" and will trip the pre-commit hook `check-yaml`. You can remove these extension, ignore this file in the hook configuration with `exclude: "mkdocs.yaml"`, or add `args: ["--unsafe"]` to the pre-commit hook.

#### Math rendering

`docs/javascript/katex.js` provides math rendering. It is referenced in `mkdocs.yaml`.

See the [mkdocs-material](https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/reference/math/) for information on math rendering.

Note that rendering ` ```math ` blocks requires a "superfences" option in `mkdocs.yaml`.

#### API docs autogeneration

`docs/api.md` gives you an example of how to use [mkdocstrings](https://mkdocstrings.github.io/) to generate API documentation from doc strings.

#### GitHub continuous integration

`.github/workflows/mkdocs.yaml` runs two jobs. On each PR and push to main, check that `mkdocs build` runs without error, and upload a copy of the build docs. On a push to main, deploy those built docs to GitHub Pages.

Note that `mkdocs gh-deploy` uses the older strategy of using GitHub Pages, by pushing to a `gh-pages` branch. The action in this repo uses artifacts instead. See the [GitHub documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/pages/getting-started-with-github-pages/configuring-a-publishing-source-for-your-github-pages-site#publishing-with-a-custom-github-actions-workflow) for more details.

## Deployment

`mkdocs gh-deploy` should just work, _whether your repo is on CDCGov or CDCEnt_. For repos on CDCGov, this will make a publicly-available website at `cdcgov.github.io/[repo]/`.

> [!CAUTION] Publicly-available websites should only by used for documentation of software developed in the corresponding repository. See the [Git and GitHub practices](github.md) page for more information on public documentation.

If your repo is on CDCEnt, a redirect will be made to a website only accessible with the appropriate credentials. That is, `cdcent.github.io/[repo]/` will redirect to an automatically generated site name (e.g., `potential-adventure-637em36.pages.github.io/`). You will only be able to access this it you are logged in and can access repos on CDCEnt.

## Contributing to this template

- These files are a skeleton so that the API documentation can build:
  - `mkdtemp/`
- These files are to check that `mkdocs` runs and the template builds in this template repo:
  - `uv.lock`
  - `pyproject.toml`
